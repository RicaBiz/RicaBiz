          <h2>How My Music Started</h2>
          <p>
                I started playing the drums very young, at around 9 years of age. This let me study classical guitar (really poorly) in middle school, which I didn't like for the first two years, but at the last year, when a new teacher arrived, I absolutely adored it and gained back my "lost" years in a whim.
                <br />I used to be in a band as a guitarist with some friends, and it was fun 'till it lasted.
                <br />I'm nowhere near as good as I'd like to be in both, but it lets me express myself enough to not be a problem.
                <br />I was extremely lucky in regards to music taste, because I got a taste of everything.
                <br />From my brother's metalhead phase I listened to everything from the 2000's Sum-41 pop-punk to the metal of Pantera and Slipknot to eventually the Deathgrips.
                <br />From my dad I listened Country, Jazz, Blues, and the very best classics of the decades previous of my birth, from Pink Floyd to Prince.
                <br />From my mom I listened to THE disco music and the mainstream pop from the 70s onwards, from Michael Jackson to Negramaro, from Pierdavide Carone to Mengoni (mom also listens to Pantera), from Simply Red to Duran Duran.
                <br />From my uncle I got more Jazz and the very best italian classics, from Battiato to Gaber.
                <br />From my era I got DUBSTEP and electronic music, I got the omnipresent Green Day and all the similars. The music that ran on the radios during the first decade of the new millenium was really something else. I also got GTA San Andreas, and all the amazing country-metal-rock-rap-soul-dance-house music that comes with it.
            </p>
          <p>
                So... What am I trying to say exactly?
                <br />I like all of it, I don't really have a genre that "speaks" more than others, as I believe all have equal opportunities (though I do have preferences), and I regurarly listen to everything. My playlists are a mess. One song can be Onde by Alex Baroni, next one could be Know Your Enemy by Rage Against the Machine, next one could be Moanin' by Art Blakey, and then APT. by Bruno Mars and Rose'.

          <h2>So... What do I like? What do <em>you</em> like?</h2>
          <p>
                As I stated before, yea I do believe all music has equal opportunity to speak to your soul. I also said I do have preferences, so what's going on here?
                <br />In reality, even though opportunities are spread equally, the entire point of the opportunities differs greatly. What is that music trying to do? Who is it looking for? What does it want to say?
                <br />The music one likes is the music that speaks directly to your soul, not to your ears only. What your soul needs or wants differs from person to person, from situation to situation, mood, time of the day, tiredness, happiness... and so on.
                <br />From this starting point, we come to the big deal: There are two ways music can speak to you. The former speaks according to your soul, the latter is changing your soul to match what it's saying. A concept so simple yet so many people seem to miss it, and many seem to forcefully ignore it altogether.
                <br />Here now we can talk about who's who, and it's easy really. Almost all the music that came into creation as a <strong>reaction</strong> to something else is mostly the former type. That's why so many bands or compositions of that type get lost through time, or many don't understand them, or lose charm in a flash. This happened countless times in all kinds of genres. It happened with hair/glam metal, with grunge, with punk, with classical music, with black music...
                <br />It's like watching Saturday Night Fever as a 2010s kid. You might like the dance scenes, but you won't understand all the hype around it, the whole meaning, and that's totally normal. You <strong>can't</strong> understand it without living it. It can be something that speaks to you personally, or something that speaks to an entire generation, an entire population, or to everyone.
                <br />To survive, some transformed into the latter, and here's my <em>kind of</em> preference. I LOVE music that makes you vibe to it instead. They have rules, some key factors, that just <em>work</em>, they're meant to work. When made by professionals, it's music you can listen to a million times and never get tired of it. This is the music you never skip on your playlists over years of personal change. And somewhere between funk and blues lie all these wonder details.
                <br />At the same time, it is vitally important to have also the former kind of music, a person to be functional just needs both, and they emphasize each other.
