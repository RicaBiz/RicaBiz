        <h2>A bit more about RicaBiz</h2>
        <p>I love music and I strongly believe playing an instrument is one of <a href="/RicaBiz/philosophy.html">The Rules Of Life</a>.
                    <br />I love classical arts even though I am and will always be more ignorant than I'd ever want to be about the culture that divinifies humanity.
                    <br />I love animals, another integral key of <a href="/RicaBiz/philosophy.html">The Rules Of Life</a>.
                    <br />I love the sea, I love the mountain, I love all countries and cultures, and I have strong opinions about everything (that I know throuroughly).
                    <br />I love cooking, and you can see my experiments in the <a href="/RicaBiz/recipes.html">Recipes</a> section.
                    <br />I'm surrounded by people who know more than me in what they like, an irreplaceable quality if someone wants to learn new stuff and a dialogue skill.

        <h2>Music and Me</h2>
        <p>I started playing the drums very young, at around 9 years old. This let me study classical guitar (really poorly) in middle school, which I didn't like for the first two years, but at the last year, when a new teacher arrived, I absolutely adored it and gained back my "lost" years in a whim.
                <br />I used to be in a band as a guitarist with some friends, and it was fun 'till it lasted.
                <br />I'm nowhere near as good as I'd like to be in both, but it lets me express myself enough to not be a problem.
                <br />I was extremely lucky in regards to music taste, because I got a taste of everything.
                <br />From my brother's metalhead phase I listened to everything from the 2000's Sum-41 pop-punk to the metal of Pantera and Slipknot to eventually the Deathgrips.
                <br />From my dad I listened Country, Jazz, Blues, and the very best classics of the decades previous of my birth, from Pink Floyd to Prince.
                <br />From my mom I listened to THE disco music and the mainstream pop from the 70s onwards, from Michael Jackson to Negramaro, from Pierdavide Carone to Mengoni (mom also listens to Pantera), from Simply Red to Duran Duran.
                <br />From my uncle I got more Jazz and the very best italian classics, from Battiato to Gaber.
                <br />From my era I got DUBSTEP and electronic music, I got the omnipresent Green Day and all the similars. The music that ran on the radios during the first decade of the new millenium was really something else. I also got GTA San Andreas, and all the amazing country-metal-rock-rap-soul-dance-house music that comes with it.
            </p>
        <p>So... What am I trying to say exactly?
                <br />I like all of it, I don't really have a genre that "speaks" more than others, as I believe all have equal opportunities (though I do have preferences), and I regurarly listen to everything. My playlists are a mess. One song can be Onde by Alex Baroni, next one could be Know Your Enemy by Rage Against the Machine, next one could be Moanin' by Art Blakey, and then APT. by Bruno Mars and Rose'.

        <h2>COOKING!</h2>
        <p>One of the most important activities anyone can do. It isn't a coincidence that gluttony is a deadly sin. 'Cuz they knew it was good. So good.</p>
        <p>I'm STRONGLY AGAINST the toxic plastic coatings on "nonstick" cookware. I have been using a carbon steel pan for half a decade now. Absolutely indestructible, and damn the food FEELS good in it.
                <br />I'm not saying you should throw away all your plastic cookware right now and buy real cookware, because waste is always bad, but I hope that next time they'll wear out, because they WILL wear out, you buy proper cookware and stop supporting the people who poisoned us.
                <br />Learn everything you'd need to know about cookware and cooking <a href="/RicaBiz/phylosophy.html">here</a>.
